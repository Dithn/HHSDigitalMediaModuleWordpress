Content toolbar icon used to search and embed HHS Digital Media content on your website.

== Description ==

This is a Wordpress plugin that can be used to search and embed HHS Digital Media content.  It has been built and tested on Wordpress 3.9.1.  It is based on the pure HTML & Javascript module found [Here](https://github.com/HHSDigitalMediaAPIPlatform/HHSDigitalMediaModuleHTML).

== Installation ==

Download the plugin zip file "hhs-digital-media-syndication.zip". In Wordpress, install this plugin by going to the Plugins menu and uploading the zip file, then activate it. Once activated, you should find a new HHS icon on the toolbar of any Wordpress Visual Editor. When creating a page or post, the visual editor will contain an icon on the toolbar which looks like the HHS logo. Clicking this icon will display a popup window which will allow you to search for HHS digital media content. Once you find the content you want, click the "Insert Media Shortcode" button to insert a shortcode in your content. Save or update your page/post. When you preview your page, the chosen syndicated content will appear on your page or post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
